### Search using the search column
However, sometimes search from chronological order is not the most convenient approach. On the homepage, there is a search column for more specific research above the links of Houses. After a researcher enters a keyword to search, they can:

- utilise the filter of House and date for receive more accurate results;
- leverage the bar chart below to observe the frequency of appearance of the keyword in UK Parliament records.

*The frequency of the keyword "pandemic" appearing in UK Parliament records from 25/11/2001 to 25/11/2021.*

When your mouse moves to a bar, you can see the specific frequency of the keyword that appeared on a certain day. However, the user cannot click the bar to check the corresponding result, which is a more direct way. All the results must be checked below the bar chart. 

When the keyword is a certain Member, the visitor can see all his/her contributions in the Parliament to observe how his/her points of view changed over time. 

One can also use the "spokenby" function to search a particular speech by a specific member.
